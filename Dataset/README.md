# Dataset

This Sub Directory contains **.mp3** files of the songs used for feature extraction.

## Usage

Download the song(s). COnvert them to **.wav** file, using [converter.py](https://github.com/vybhav72954/Audio_Features/blob/master/Dataset/converter.py)

Additional Audio_parameters of the songs can be obtained using [audio_parameteres.py](https://github.com/vybhav72954/Audio_Features/blob/master/Dataset/audio_parameteres.py)

In order to change the Parameters as desired use [downsample.py](https://github.com/vybhav72954/Audio_Features/blob/master/Dataset/downsample.py) {TODO}
## Features

Features have been extracted, as file size>25mb looking for a better way to showcase my findings. **Example** folder will be soon updated with either a Google Drive Link or any other means after discussing with peers.
